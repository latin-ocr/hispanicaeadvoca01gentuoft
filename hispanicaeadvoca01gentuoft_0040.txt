3651 Introduction

foggers of the common law have pushed their way into
marriage cases ’‘ and into similar actions at law, “shall they
rush in and seize these cases involving foreigners?’'

CHAPTER XXII.—On tlze absence of riqht to take away or transfer
possession from those who are said to have bouqht property
stolen by pirates and even to have houqht it from the pirates.

Certain Englishmen have bought property stolen from
Venetians by English pirates. May the English buyers recover
the price which they paid? The law covering the situation
is based on the case of a woman sentenced to the salt pits who
was seized by foreign brigands and sold. The purchases
recovered from the fiscus the price paid for the woman. From
this law the commentators draw the conclusion that the man
who buys a stolen article, or an article taken by brigandS‚ may
recover the price of it from the owner. The fact that the law
speaks of foreign brigands may not be urged against this
conclusion, because the jurist uses the word “ foreign ’' on
account of a situation peculiar to the case before him. The
law is of general application, as the commentators recognize.
Furthermore “the law thinks of the nation of the robbers
as foreign, not from the point of view of him who pays the
ransom . . . but from the point of view of the party from
whom the woman had been stolen, that is, the fiscus.'' We
have in this case, therefore, the exact situation contemplated
in the law, viz., foreign robbers, the English, and Venetian
owners. It makes the case stronger that the English purchasers
got this property from a foreign source, viz., the Tunisian
prefect. In any case the property should not be transferred,
because, even if ownership of stolen property can not be
acquired, the right to possess it is recognized.

CHAPTER XXIII.—-Whetlzer the purchasers of plunder may keep it
for themselves.

Supplementing the argument in Chapter XXII, it should
be noted that the English merchants bought the property at
issue from the fiscus of TuniS, and one is secure in his rights
who buys from the fiscus of any prince. This case differs
from the case in which Spaniards and the fiscus of Barbary
