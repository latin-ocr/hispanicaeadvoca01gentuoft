tions. Thus, in writing to the junior counsel in one of the cases
in which they both appeared, he says:

Your arguments were outside the present inquiry. Most learned man, always
remember to notice the form which the question takes, although you can include,
and perhaps also at times ought to include, what either may not be pertinent
to the matter, or may be of no weight. By such things some judges are often
more influenced than they are by appropriate and sound considerations.16

In another personal letter he says of a judge before whom he
had recently appeared:

At eight o'clock in the evening he was asked by me to examine all the points,
at sunrise the next morning he gave a judgment against us; and on another
occasion after hearing the representations of six advocates on the other side up
to the hour for dinner, right after dinner he gave an interlocutory decree, with-
out examining other statements (I believe this at any rate) or the opinion of
Cravetta (this I know for sure), on which our strongest argument was based.1⁷

In presenting his arguments Gentili shows a thorough ac-
quaintance with the facts in the case and with the principles
which underlie it. He has a logical mind and his method of
argumentation is keen. SometimeS‚ indeed, his shrewdness is
carried so far that his reasoning lacks the note of sincerity. In
attempting an appreciation of the literary form of his pleas,
it is only fair to bear in mind two considerationS. He was ad-
dressing a seventeenth not a twentieth century court, and he
did not see this book through the press, Gentili was a very
learned man, and not only the weight but the actual number of
authorities which an advocate cited counted heavily in the mind
of a judge. It was natural, therefore, for Gentili‚ out of his wide
reading, to multiply references to earlier jurists. It is not im-
possible too that he may have felt a pride in doing SO, but this
display of learning is somewhat tedious to the present-day reader,
and interferes with the continuity of the argument. He errs also
on the side of completeness by arraying too many arguments in
support of his cause. Some of them will not bear close examina-
tion, and a elever opponent would have been able to make a
specious case against him by directing the attention of the court
to arguments of this sort. Here again he is merely following
contemporary practice in bringing in every consideration which
