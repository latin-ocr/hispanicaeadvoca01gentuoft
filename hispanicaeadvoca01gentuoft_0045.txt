ΙΙΙ.

OBITER DICTA.

The observations which Gentili makes in the course of his
arguments, on general principles of law and on matters of
contemporary usage, illustrate his practical wisdom and his
grasp of the doctrines on which the Law of Nations rests. For
that reason a few of them have been set down here.

The law is intended for cases in which doubt may arise.
It is to be interpreted on this basis (Bk. 1, Ch. 1).

. A legal enemy is not like a fugitive from justice (Bk. I,
Ch. 1).

The law governing pirates and wild beasts is not applicable
to enemies‚ i.e.‚ there are laws of war (Bk. I, Ch. 4).

A usage does not admit extension in the matter of place,
persons, situations, or time (Bk. I, Ch. 4).

War is not a hunt. Political territory is something more
than a private domain (Bk. Ι, Ch. 5).

The immunity of a church is opposed to the public interest
and to the common law (Bk. I, Ch. 5).

Α neutral is called upon to hand over the spoils of wtar to
the victor only after a complete victory (Bk. I, Ch. 5).

The jurisdiction of a church differs from that of a prince,
because to be exempt from local jurisdiction is not the same
as to be outside a territory (Bk. I, Ch. 5).

The doctrine of continuous stealing is based on the fact
that not only the seizure of the property of another but also
the retention of it is an act of theft (Bk. I, Ch. ὁ).

The case of a man who flees to a church and of a man
being forcibly taken through it are identical (Bk. Ι, Ch. 7).

“Whatever stands in the original is implied in full in the
citation'' (Bk. I, Ch. 7).

“The dicta of learned men should be interpreted in
accordance with the laws and the authorities which they have
cited ’³ (Bk. I, Ch. 7).

The last statement of a writer is to be preferred to an
earlier one (Bk. I, Ch. 7).
