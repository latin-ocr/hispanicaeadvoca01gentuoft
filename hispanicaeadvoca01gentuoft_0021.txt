Introduction 17a

iards, when Spain and England were at war, shows that it is
contrary to the Law of Nations for a neutral people to send arms
to belligerent nations with whom they are at peace, and in this
connection he coinSJthe apothegm: “ Do not unto others what ye
would not that they should do unto you.” (4) The treaty be-
tween England and Spain forbids either people to furnish aid
to the enemy of the other, and Spain is the ally of the Emperor
who is at war with the Turks. Therefore the English may not
aid Turkey. Indeed Christians are at all times at war with the
Turks,

In reply to his own formulation of the arguments of his
opponents Gentili maintains: (1) Part of the cargo was made
up of lawful merchandise, and that at least is exempt from con-
fiscation‚ unless it can be shown that the owners of the lawful
merchandise were cognizant of the unlawful goods. (2) The
English were en route. They might have turned back before
reaching Constantinople. The offense had not been committed
until the act was complete. (3) The powder may have been
intended for the ship’s defense. Even in those States where
the exportation of grain is forbidden, a man going abroad may
take enough with him for his Journey, and if the English had
any powder left over it would have been lawful for them to sell
it at their journey‘s end. (4) The carriage of powder would not
be unlawful per se. The powder might have been used by one
faction of the Turks against another. (5) The English owners
made out manifests before the proper English officials and, un·
der the Orders in Council of Queen Elizabeth, may carry their
goods anywhere. The English have therefore observed the Eng-
lish statutes and they can not be held amenable to the laws of
any other sovereign. (ὁ) The treaty between England and Spain
does not apply in this case, because Spain is not at war with
Turkey‚ and the naming of the King of Spain among the allies
of the Emperor is a formality without meaning. Accordingly
Gentili concludes that the Maltese may obstruet the trade of
England with the TurkS, but may not punish English shipowners
1n person or 1n property.

The serious tone of the arguments in the Advocatio is re-
lieved now and then by confidential letters of comment on topics
connected with some of the cases. These letters sometimes reveal
the shrewdness of Gentili or throw light on contemporary condi-
