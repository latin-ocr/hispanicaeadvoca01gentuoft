THE HISPANICA ADVOCATIO.

There are two periods in the active life of Alberico Gen-
tili.1 Twenty years of it he spent at Oxford, tea⁴ching
civil law and writing on the Law of Nations. The last
eight years of it he passed mainly in London‚ in the practice
of his profession. Within these eight years the Hispania-cz Ad-
vocatio falls. The book therefore represents Gentili's final
judgment on many weighty matters. It contains the application
to concrete cases of the legal principles which he had been
teaching for a score of years. No other jurist of his time has
left us this double record, of his theory of the law and of his
practice of it.

But it is not merely the theoretical and the practical methods
followed by Gentili in approaching legal questions which we
find illustrated in this twofold record of his activity as a jurist.
The relation between the two parts is much more intimate. In
the greatest of his books, in his treatise On tlze Law of [Van. he
had set down the principles which should govern the conduct
of war. In the Pleas of a Spanislz Advocate he is concerned
with war again, but this time he is applying the principles which
he had laid down in the earlier work to the actual questions
arising out of a great war of his own time. During the last
partos the sixteenth century and the early days of the seventeenth‚
Spain and the Netherlands were fighting each other. Out of
