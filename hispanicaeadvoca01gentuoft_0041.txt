were concerned1 in two fundamental points: (1) Barbary
and Spain were enemies, but Turkey and Venice have treaty
relations. Consequently the Venetians may bring action against
Turkey. (2) In the former case the fiscus of Barbary
interposed only as a matter of form. My second general
argument is that the Roman laws which have been cited
were applicable to the citizens of a common State, the Roman
Empire. They can not apply to conditions today when, as in
this case, the litigants are citizens of different States. Thirdly‚
piracy must be distinguished from theft. The rule of the
Law of Nations is that “it is lawful to buy anything and
from anyone.” “Even wares taken by pirates belong to
unrestricted commerce.’' In the fourth place the Venetians
must prove the identity of their property and the property
which they claim. As a fifth point I note that when the robbers
belong to a foreign nation there is no ground for recovery,
because pirates who are likewise enemies may acquire owner-
ship, and the treaty between Turkey and Venice does not
cover pirates. Finally the trade of the English with Tunis‚
Algeria and many other States is taken from thern by the
Venetian claim that these States are piratical retreats‚ and that
the people and even the magistrates in them are pirates.

CHAPTER XXIV.——Of inquisitions and the testimony of Turks.

Two direct questions arise in this case: (1) When may
torture be used to ascertain the truth, and (2) what weight
should be given to the testimony offered by Turks? Slave
witnesses may not be tortured, if the question is one of money
only, and if the truth can be ascertained otherwise. Freemen
may be tortured only when they are charged as accomplices‚
and give inconsistent evidence. The matter is left to the
discretion of the magistrate. So far as the second point goes,
the testimony of Turks is not accepted against Christians.
In addition to the two dire-ct questions just mentioned, two
points are indirectly involved in the case. What is the value
of testimony given by witnesses under torture, and how should
perjury on their part be treated? What bearing has this
and other evidence on the ownership of the property in
