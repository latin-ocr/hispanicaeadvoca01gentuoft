38a Introduction

controversy here? Testimony given under torture is incon-
clusive, and if perjury was committed under torture, witnesses
should not be punished. The invoices in the bundles of goods
seem to favor the Turks, but this evidence is shown to be
worthless² by the fact that they are written on Christian, not
on Turkish paper, and, consequently, were not made out in
Turkey. Likewise the theft of the records from the Englishmen
raises a presumption against their opponents.

CHAPTER XXV.—Of commerce with the Turks.

The Tuscans have objected to the carriage of Turks on an
English vessel, and the payment by the Turks of passage-money.
They say that the law forbids commerce with the Turks.

I would say that the Law of Nations makes no distinction
between nations in the matter of trade, and that “between a

prince and the subject of another nation it is the practice
that the civil law should not apply, but rather the Law of
Nations alone.’' In further reply on this case Ι would note
that the King of England approves of these commercial
relations, that the English had not com'pleted the transaction,
that the trade was not forbidden, because it was of no direct
help to the Turks, that it was free from evil intent against
Tuscans or other ChristianS, that it was a case of conveyance
from, not to Turkey, that contraband goods were not involved,
that there was no legal state of war between Tuscany and
Turkey, and that Tuscany will not wish to make this attack
on English commerce. The case of the Hanseatic peoples
which Ι once argued is not parallel to this case, because here
we are dealing with mere raids which go on forever and
constantly interfere with trade.

CHAPTER XXVI.—Of an Enqlish ship seized for the use of the

Tuscans and then lost.

An English ship on the Tuscan coast was requisitioned,
sent to war, and lost on her way back to Tuscany. The English
owners claim compensation. The Tuscans offer as a defense
that their contract called on them only to make good any loss
incurred in warfare, and that, therefore, loss in any other way
