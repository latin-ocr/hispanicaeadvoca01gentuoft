¹ The interest which has been awakened in recent years in Gentili, and our apprecia-
tion of the great service which he rendered in the development of international law,
date from the inaugural lecture delivered on his life and writings by Professor Sir
Thomas Erskine Holland in 1874 at Oxford.

²Exact dates unknown. When St. John’s College was established on a permanent
foundation in 1558, theology‚ philosophy, civil law and canon law were declared to be
the subjects to which the scholars were to devote themselves, and of the.fifty Fellows
and Scholars twelve were to study civil and common law; cf. W. H. HUTTON, S. John
Baptist Colleqe (London, 1898), p. 15. The teaching was conducted bv the Readers.
and an account book of the College (op. cit„ p. 59) reveals the fact that the Lector Iuris
Civilis received 3 salary of twenty-five shillings for the first term of the year 1583.

⁸ Onlv the principa! writings of Gentili are included in this list.

⁴While on this mission Gentili lectured at Wittenberg‚ and there renewed his
acquaintance with his countryman, Giordano Bruno, for as Bruno testified later at his
trial in Venice, “He (Gentili) gave me his support, and introduced me to lecture on the
Orqanon of Aristotle ''; cf. D. BERT1, Giordano Bruno da Nola: Sua Vita e Sua Dollrina
(Rome, 1868), Appendix‚ Document IX. The two men had undoubtedlv met in Oxford.
Both of them were friends of Sir Philip Sidney. To Sidney, Gentili dedicated the
treatise On Embassies. and Bruno, his two important works on moral subjectS, viz.,
Spaccio della bestia trionsante and Gli croici furori. Bruno’s two books appeared about
1585. Furthermore. in the work of Bruno which bears the title De l’Infinioeo Universa
e Mondi, published in 1584, there are five dialogues which show the direction to be
taken by science. In these dialogues he introduces real people as interlocutors, and in
the fifth dialogue Alberico Gentili 15 introduced; cf. W. BOULTlNG, Giordano Bruno:
His Life, Thouqlzt and Martyrdom (New York, 1916), p. 139. All these facts would
seem to point to an intimate acquaintance between the two Italian scholars.
