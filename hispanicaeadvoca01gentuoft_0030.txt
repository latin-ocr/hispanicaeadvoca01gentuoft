to it, but that the case of a person being conducted through a
church stands on a different basiS. I assert, however, that it
is not the mere flight to the church, as a place of refuge, but
our reverence for the sanctity of the church which brings
safety.

In a question involving the immunity of a church, we
should follow canon law, and canon law makes no distinction
between the case of the man who flees to a church and that
of him who is being conducted through a church, and this
theory of the situation is upheld by usage and by decisions
of the courts.

CHAPTER VIRâ€”The protection of sea-territory.

In this case the Dutch were intercepted by an officer of
the King of Great Britain and made to come to on the high
seas with booty taken from Spaniards. The word territory
(as I have shown in my books on war) applies to both land
and water. Scholars state that the Venetians and the Genoese
claim sovereignty and jurisdiction to a point one hundred miles
from their ports, if their shores are not near another State.
The jurisdiction of the English King is, therefore, immeasur-
able to the south, north and west. The Dutch, however,
maintain that by an English royal edict certain boundaries
were laid down beyond which the King refuses to have his
territorial power extended to cover these acts of war between
the Dutch and the Spaniards, They maintain also that they
were intercepted beyond these boundaries. But a treaty of
peace between the British and Spanish Kings requires each
to protect subjects of the other anywhere within his territories,
and the edict must be interpreted in the light of the treaty
which is a contract. Otherwise a wrong would be done one
of the contracting partieS, because the peace agreement pro-
vided that each sovereign was to allow no violence to subjects
of the other in his territory. The Dutch assert that the edict
merely fixed in permanent form boundaries which had long
been recognized by usage. The King took no account of
usage in making the treaty. Probably he did not know of it,
and most certainly the Spanish King did not. Further the
captor was really committing piracy under letters of masque,
and not carrying on war. This predatory warfare is waged
