jurisdiction, he is not set free by virtue of this fact. It may
also be argued that “ if in another's territory it is not lawful
to seize what belongs to the enemy, neither should what has
been seized elsewhere be released there.” Again it is urged
that “ traveling is unrestricted '' and “the sea and seashore are
the common property of everybody.'’ May the King of England
take from his friends, the Dutch, to aid his friends, the Spanish?
Furthermore the carriage of corpses through the territory of a
town is expressly permitted under the law.

The parallel drawn between our case and that of the
carriage of grain will not bear investigation, because “it does
not concern a city, if grain which has not been grown in its
territory . . . be carried through it.” In transporting dead
bodies through a territory no force is applied, and no wrong
is done to the territory concerned. Above all “these captured
possessions have not yet been made the property of the enemy,
and therefore here in the territory of the King, who is the
friend of both parties, no force should be brought to bear on
the things captured.” “ Force is brought to bear not only at
the time when a person and when a thing is seized by force,
but then also when they are taken along by force.” Thus, as
Barbatia says, “a thies who flees with stolen property to a
church is said to commit a new theft there because of the
newly occurring act of stealing.'' “Now it concerns a territory
that there be no one but the ruler of the territory to inspire
sear in it.’‘ “It is of importance that no captives whatever
be taken, held, or dragged off except by order of the ruler
of the territory, for these acts derive from jurisdiction, and
jurisdiction in the territory of our king does not belong to
any foreigner.”

CHAPTER VIL—lee opinion of Archidiaconus with reference to a
captive conducted tlzrouqlz a church is examined.

Against our defense offered in the last chapter the opinion
of Archidiaconus is cited to the effect that, if a person seized
by a bailiff, and being conducted through a church, be taken
therefrom by force, the immunity of the church is not violated.
But it is not clear that Archidiaconus held this view, and other
doctors hold the opposite opinion. It is maintained by our
opponents that the church grants immunity to those who fiee
