Introduction 33a

and the Turks are not only heathen, but they are alien heathen,
because they are not subjects of the Emperor. The canon
law forbids furnishing Saracens with munitions of war, and
the Turks are Saracens. The Law of Nations also seems to
be against the English, because, as I have said in my books
On tlze Law of lVar‚ it was unlawful for the Hanseatic cities
to furnish supplies and war material to the Spaniards, when
Spain and England were at war.

Under the articles of peace and the treaty of alliance
between England and Spain, the English seem to be in the
wrong, because these documents forbid the subjects of one
of the sovereigns to furnish munitions of war to enemies of
the other or to rebels against the other's authority. Now
Spain is one of the allies of the Emperor, who is fighting
the Turks, and the Emperor is mentioned as one of the
supporters of Spain in the treaty of peace, and furthermore
Spain has the right of succession to the lands over which the
Emperor and the Turks are fighting. It would seem to follow
therefore that the Turks are enemies of the Spaniards, and
consequently of the Sardinians and Maltese.

In spite of the general arguments mentioned above, certain
considerations make me feel that the Sardinians and Maltese
are wronging the English. First‚ concerning the lawful goods
on the English ship‚ if their owners did not know that the
vessel carried contraband‚ as the great writers teach, or if they
did not consent to its presence on the ship‚ as most doctors hold,
the owners of lawful goods should suffer no loss. In this
case it can not be shown that they were aware that the vessel
carried contraband‚

In the second place, the law applicable in this case reads:
“If anyone shall have sold.” It requires a completed act.
The Englishmen were captured en route.

Thirdly, the powder and other war material were being
carried for the ship's use. Even where the exportation of
grain is forbidden, a traveler is allowed to carry enough for
his own use. If the quantity of powder on board seem large,
it must be remembered that it is not safe to make too careful
a calculation in such a matter, and if any of the munitions
of war, carried for the ship’s use, were left over, the English
could lawfully sell them. If it be objected that the law forbids
the carrying of even a soupgon of such articles to the Turks,
