inasmuch as Spain and Britain are at peace, or shall it be
left untouched, on the ground that it was won by the
Dutch?

The case centers about the interpretation of a Spanish
decree which lays down the principle that, when a ship has
more Britons than foreigners in its crew, it is to be regarded
as piratical, if it attack a Spanish ship. My opponents may
maintain that the Dutch vessel stood by, while the capture
was being made, that the two vessels therefore constituted a unit,
and that when so regarded the Britons were in the minority.
Consequently this was not an act of piracy.

I reply that the Dutch have no legal claim to any booty‚
because the property was not brought within their fortified
lines.² Besides the Dutch vessel's share can come only from
what the British ship has. The capture was made by the
British ship, and in the intent of the Spanish decree she was
clearly a pirate, so that the Dutch have no claim whatsoever.

May it be recovered?

Even the man who buys stolen property in good faith must
restore it to its rightful owner. This enemy of the Spaniards
was a pirate because he was associated with the crew of a
piratical vessel, and he can not plead that he did not know
the character of the vessel. Finally he 'had not brought this
captured property “within the fortified lines ’' of his country-
men.1

CHAPTER XII.—Of property captured hy pirates and afterwards
houqlzt by friends in tlte enemy’s country.

Property taken from the Spaniards by pirates has been ,
bought in Barbary by friends and allies of Spain. “May the
merchants who bought it recover from the Spaniards the price
which they paid?” If property is bought back from a legal
