A man born in Holland is a British subject, provided his
father has been naturalized (Bk. I, Ch. 17).

It is lawful and not unbecoming for an ambassador to
manage the lawsuits of his nationals (Bk. I, Ch. 18).

Ambassadors are comparable with the governors of Roman
provinces, but this parallel must not be pressed too far
(Bk. I, Ch. 18).

“Do not unto others what ye would not that they should
do unto you ” (Bk. I, Ch. 20). ‚

The Englishman follows the law of his native land, not
the canon or civil law (Bk. Ι, Ch. 20).

The kinship of princes does not determine public policy
(Bk. Ι, Ch. 20).

He who gives aid in war is in a state of war, but is not
carrying on war on his own account (Bk. Ι, Ch. 20).

- “The civil law, especially in maritime cases, is a sort of
Law of Nations'’ (Bk. I, Ch. 21).

Roman law was drawn up for the citizens of a single State.
Consequently it is not always applicable when the citizens
of several States are involved (Bk. Ι, Ch. 23).

Under the Law of Nations “it is lawful to buy anything
and from anyone'' (Bk. Ι, Ch. 23).

The Law of Nations allows trade in times of peace with
any nation, even with the Turks (Bk. Ι, Ch. 25).

“Between a prince and the subject of another nation . . .
the Law of Nations should apply'' (Bk. I, Ch. 25).

The inclusion of one chance occurrence in a lease does not
exclude other risks (Bk. I, Ch. 26).

“ Contracts with princes . . . imply good faith” (Bk. I,
Ch. 26).

He is presumed to be the aggressor, who has thought him-
self wronged, who is armed‚ who is stronger, whose profession
is one of arms and who comes off victor (Bk. Ι, Ch. 27).

The right of search at sea is of doubtful validity‚ and
would hold only off the coasts of the prince who owns the
warship claiming the right (Bk. Ι, Ch. 27).

“Wrong is done to us when it is done to another, who
is in our home, for a ship herself is likened to a home”
(Bk. I, Ch. 27).

In the payment of a debt, “the victor takes the place of
the vanquished’' (Bk. Ι, Ch. 28).
