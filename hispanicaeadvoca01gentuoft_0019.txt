all other claims over such persons and property. Probably
Gentili‘s arguments on these matters contributed largely to
settle, for the future, phases of these two great questions, of
jurisdiction beyond the coast-line and of the rights of belliger-
ents in neutral territory.

The majority of the cases which he pleads, however, involve
questions that in one aspect or another are still much under
discussion. A friend inquires of him, for instance, if the natural-
ization of a Dutchman in England will make the Dutchman's
son, who was born in Holland, a British subject.⁰ The Spanish
Ambassador's right to intervene in civil actions in the English
courts in behalf of Spanish subjects is questioned, and the Am-
bassador appeals to Gentili for advice.10 The author urges re-
peatedly in one form or another the English doctrine of the free-
dom of the high seas. “ Et iter marinum, non est liberrimum ?'' he
says. On the other hand, the rights of a harbor must be protected
at all costs. One case which he argues is that of a Spanish vessel,
carrying troops or supplies to the Netherlands, which had been
attacked off an English port and had taken refuge in the harbor.
The Dutchmen seem to have been lying off the port when the
trial opened, waiting for the Spaniards to come out.11 Gentili
maintains that the course pursued by the Dutch is in violation
of English sovereignty, that the King of England should give
the Spaniards a safe conduct, not to Spain, but to Belgium,
whither they had set out, and should hold the Dutch back until
the Spaniards had gone a safe distance.

In one argument in defense of maritime rights he takes even
a more advanced position than is commonly assumed today. The
Tuscans and the Turks were raiding each other, although Gentili
says that a state of legal warfare did not exist between them3 a
Tuscan ship of war attempted to stop an English merchant vessel
carrying Turks and Turkish property, and the Englishmen re-
sisted. Gentili claims damages for the loss suffered by the
English and in the course of his argument says: “The defense
made by the English in behalf of the Turks, who certainly would
have been molested by the Tuscans on board the ship of our
countrymen was honorable. Thus wrong is done to us when
it is done to another who is in our home, for a ship herself is
