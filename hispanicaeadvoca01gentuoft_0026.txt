ANALYSIS OF BOOK I.²

CHAPTER I.—Whether there is postliminium in the domain of a
common friend.

“The question at issue is whether certain LusitanianS, who
have been taken prisoners by Dutch enemies on the Spanish
sea, become free here in England, by way of which they were
being taken to Holland.'' The law bearing on the case reads
that “it is understood that a person is back again from the
moment when he reaches our friend,'' and “our'’ should be
understood as properly used of a friend to both belligerent
parties, i.e.‚ a neutral. If the word were restricted in its
application to a people friendly to one of the belligerents and
hostile to the other, it would be superfluouS, since it would
state a self-evident truth‚ whereas law deals with cases in
which doubt may arise. The historical argument that captive
Romans, sold by Carthaginians in Greece, were not set free
by Greece is not to the point, because friendly relations between
Rome and Greece had not been set up at the time the
incident in question occurred, and there had been little previous
intercourse between the two countries. It may even be said
that in the particular case of Greece and Rome, postliminium
would not exist, because the man who bought a particular slave
would have the right of ownership. Many doctors might lead
us astray in this matter because in discussing the application
of the law they are thinking of fugitives from justice who
have fled from one State to another, and not of the subjects, in
a neutral territory, of one of two belligerent powers.

¹ To preserve the directness of Gentili’s arguments and the persona! note in thern, it
has seemed wise to summarize his pleas without comment, to quote his own words,
where it is possible, and to use the first person singular. The title of each chapter is
given in italics at the head of the summary. Book 11 has not been analyzed, because
it is devoted almost entirely to questions of private law.
