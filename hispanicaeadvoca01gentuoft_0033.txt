enemy, this would be the case, but it is not true of property
bought from pirates,

CHAPTER XIII.—Articles sold in Brazz‘l in violation of the law are
souqht in Enqland hy tlze Spanish fiscus.

‘⁴ A sale was made to Dutch enemies and to other aliens in
contravention of the laws of the Portuguese kingdom, which
forbids commerce there with those who are not Portuguese.’'
Therefore its confiscation by the Spanish fiscus automatically
followed, inasmuch as the illicit sale was made by Spaniards.
This property, which is now in England, Spain asks to have
turned over to her. Personal property is under the control of
the judge who confiscates it, even if it be outside of his territory.
Ownership was not transferred to the buyers, because the law
forbids commercial transactions of this sort. Consequently
also, the purchases loses the purchase money.

The Dutch buyers can not claim to hold it, on the ground
that they have acquired it from their Spanish enemies‚ until
they have brought it within their fortified lines. But the
. property is in England. It may be urged that “it is not lawful
to summon to court a foreigner passing through the country
with any property, nor to have any property taken from him.”
This principle does not apply if the judge who has jurisdiction
over the fugitive, in this case the King of Spain, brings the suit.

CHAPTER XIV.—Whether the Kinq may riqhtfully decide that Span-
iards who have been routhy handled hy the Dutch off a
port of tlze King] may sail in safety to Belqium.

Spaniards were attacked by the Dutch off an English harbor
and are now blockaded in the harbor. It is not lawful to
commit such acts in foreign territory. The heat of battle and
the plea that the Dutch did not recognize the fact that they
were in English territorial waters can not excuse them. “The
blockaded man is a man held captive,’' and the doctors teach‚
and usage shows, that, “if one has been captured in a place
where he ought not to have been captured, he should even
be allowed to make his way to a place of security with such
safeguards that pursuit would be difficult.'’
