CHAPTER XXI.—On lzoldinq to tlze civil law in appeals from a judqe
of the Admiralty.

When an appeal is taken from an Admiralty judge, shall
those w=ho profess the English common law, as well as those
who profess the English civil law, sit on the appellate bench?

My opponents say that note should be taken of the common
law in the Admiralty Court, that this court is ordered to
give its decisions in accordance with “our law‚’' and that it
is customary to put on the appellate bench those versed in
either law, according to the discretiori of the person making
the appointments. I maintain that the function of appellate
judges is to determine whether the judge in the first instance
gave a righteous decision under the law which he professes.
Civil law is followed in the Admiralty Court. Consequently
the appellate judges should all be professors of English civil
law.

In the second place, the civil law and the common law have
different and even conflicting basic principles, and those who
practice the two kinds of law are unfriendly to each other, so
that a common agreement would be difficu1t‚ and frequent
reversals of the, decision of the Admiralty Court would be
inevitable.

In the third place, the English common law is not suitable
in meting out justice to foreigners. What statute of the common
law, for instance, would give the formula for a transaction in
Spain between a Frenchman and an Italian, so that in judicial
proceedings instituted here, a verdict could be given in
accordance with the common law? But everyone accepts the
civil law as a Law of Nations, so to speak. Indeed‚ the
principles of the Law of Nations come from the civil law.

In reply to the arguments urged by my opponentS‚ I may
say that if note is taken of the common law by the civil law
judges of the Admiralty, civil law judges in the appellate
court can likewise take it into consideration. Since the judge
appointed to administer the law in the Admiralty Court is a
civil law judge, “our law '' would seem to be the English
civil law. The argument from usage is invalid because it
would have to be proved that each of the two foreign parties
to the suit had a common usage. “ Granted that these petti-
