12a Introduction

this conflict there developed between the Spanish and the Dutch
a great many difficult questions of international law, in which
England as a neutral nation was concerned, and, as Gentili's
brother Scipione remarks in his preface to the Advocatio, James
I “ could not help allowing the controversies and quarrels which
these people had referred to him to be settled in accordance with
the principles of law and equity.'' The cases at issue were heard
by the English Court of Admiralty‚ and Alberico Gentili, with
the approval of King James, represented the interests of Spain
at the hearingS. He acted in this capacity from 1605 up to his
death in 1608. His appointment to this post testifies to the high
esteem in which he was held as a jurist and to the reputation
throughout the world which his writings on international law
had brought him. Perhaps the opinion which he rendered to
the English court in the case of the Ambassador Mendoza also
made the King of Spain look with favor on his appointment.
Mendoza had been involved in the Throgmorton plot directed
against Queen Elizabeth‚ and inquiry was made of Gentili if
he could be sentenced to death in England. Although public
feeling ran high, and although many men would have yielded
to the popular demand for the exemplary punishment of an
ambassador who had violated the elementary principles of hos-
pitality in supporting the plot of assassins and revolutionists‚ he
bravely replied that no other action could be taken against
Mendoza than dismissal from England.

The arguments which he made in support of Spanish claims
and the opinions which hc wrote on other matters of interna-
tional and of private law were published in the Hispanica Advo-
catio. Perhaps among legal works of this period this book is
unique. It seems unique in two respects. The jurists who pre-
ceded Gentili or were his contemporaries composed treatises on
general subjects or wrote comments and observations on par-
ticular laws or on cases largely fictitious. In this book, as we
have intimated above, Gentili presents the arguments actually
made before the court and arguments made where important
issues were at stake. Dealing as it does largely with decisions,
precedents and usage, it is conceived more in the spirit of modern
discussions of the subject than any of the other legal writings
of the time. It is unique also in the fact that the letters which
