Introduction 19a

has a bearing on the question at issue, and he should be judged
by the usage of his own time.

It was unfortunate that the Advocatio was not published in
Gentili's own lifetime. Had it been, he would probably have
improved its form at many points. His brother doubtless
brought it out exactly as it stood in the manuscript. Many of
his sentences are obscure, awkwardly expressed and involved,
and not infrequently we find memoranda rather than fully ex-
panded arguments These characteristics make certain Das-
sages very hard to understand. Gentili had a reasonablv clear
style, as one can see in his treatises On Embassz'es and On the
Low of War and probably the form of this book would have
been much improved, if the author had had an opportunity to
revise IL

The attitude which Gentili took toward the different branches
of law and the method which he followed in establishing judicial
principles are more clearly shown in the Advocatio than in any
of his other writings, and perhaps in that fact the primary im-
portance of this work lies, In the first place he broke away from
ecclesiastical tradition. Most of his predecessors, men like
Covarruvias‚ Suarez, Molina and Soto, who were Catholic theo-
logians, carried over into their discussions of international law the
principles of the canon law and the method of a priori reasoning.
Gentili was a jurist by profession; his adherence to Protestantism
released him from ecclesiastical preconceptionS, and the bent of
his own mind seems to have led him to the practice of examining
concrete cases of his own time and of drawing practical rules
from them. He may therefore with propriety be called the
founder of the modern historical school of international law. It
is characteristic of this change of attitude in the study of the
Law of Nations that probably not one in fifty of his own ref-
erences in the Advocatio is to the canon law, and when the us-
ages of the Law of Nations and the teachings of the canon law
come into conflict, as they do in the discussion given above of
the right of the English to trade with the TurkS, canon law must
yield.

He broke away from his predecessors also in giving up
largely the attempt to cast the Law of Nations in the mould of
the Roman civil law. As he remarks at one point,¹⁸ the ancient
