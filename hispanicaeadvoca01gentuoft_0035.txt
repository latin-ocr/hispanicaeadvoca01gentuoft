King could make the law applicable at once, and that ignorance
of it would not make the English secure in their claim to
what was taken. Three cases present themselves: The act
may have occurred, (1) before April 24, (2) after peace was
concluded, (3) between these two limits. In the first case the
booty belongs to the privateer. In the second case it must
be given back. The third case, and this is ours, is uncertain,
because the edict says that “account must be rendered of acts
committed after April 24.” “To render an account '' does
not naturally mean “to restore property taken.’' The question
is left to the discretion of the judge, who in this case will
probably take into consideration the fact that the privateer
was on the high scas and presumably did not know of the
edict, so that the attack was not unjust. He will also probably
remember that the English vessel was maintained at private
expense, and that the profits went to private personS, and will
therefore perhaps hesitate to take from them the fruit of
their toil.

If a civil action has been brought and sustained to recover
property, not to inflict punishment, a criminal prosecution may
follow.

A man born in Holland is a British subject, provided his
father has been naturalized in England. This is the case
even if the son has not yet given his consent to naturalization,
and was not mentioned in the naturalization papers.

If Brukus «was a pirate, the edict of the King does not
