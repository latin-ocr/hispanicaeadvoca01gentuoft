that usages vary from one period to another and from one
place to another.

CHAPTER V.—lVlzether it is lawful to capture the enemy in the
territory of another.

One may pursue a wild beast into a neighbor’s field or a
fugitive from justice into another's territory, and one may hold
with the ancients that “war is a hunt‚'’ and with the doctors
that “a territory is nothing else than a domain‚’' drawing the
conclusion therefrom that a public enemy may be captured
in another's territory. But this conclusion is false. “The
territory of another insures safety, and, when territory changeS,
control changeS.’' It is commonly held that when a fugitive
flees into a church, he is safe. This privilege is opposed to
the public interest and to the theory of the common law, but
if the doctrine holds in the case of a church, it is still more
applicable when there is 3 complete change of territory. If it
holds for a fugitive from justice, it should surely hold under
the laws of war. But what shall we say to the principle of law
which Ι have laid down in my books On the Law of War
that “ anybody and everybody is bound to hand over to the
victor the property and the person of the vanquished?’' I
reply that “this doctrine may be affirmed in the case of a
complete victory, not in the case of a small succes8.’' “ It may
not be lawt'ul per se for the victor to take the spoils, and he
who rules a territory may not always be required to turn them
over to the victor.‘’

CHAPTER VL—leettzer it is lawful to conduct an enemy captive
tlzrouqh another’s territory.

“The Spanish Ambassador opposes the action of the Dutch
in taking property captured from their Spanish enemies . .
through the British sea and along these shores, and he asks the
magistrate here that all the property be stopped and be re-
leased.’' Various arguments may be urged 1n opposition to this
request. For instance, it is lawful to transport grain through
a place from which it is unlawful to export it. Some doctors
also hold that if a criminal is being conducted through the
graveyard of a church, or even through territory under another
