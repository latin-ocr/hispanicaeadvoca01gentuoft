16a Introduction

comparable to a home.” ¹² In general he regards the right of
search at sea as of doubtful validity, and only to be exercised
off the coasts of the prince who owns the warship claiming it.¹³
Another interesting point is raised by the plight of some English—
men who have been recruited in a neutral country, EngIand, for
service under the Spanish flag, and captured, while on their
way to join the Spanish forces, by the Dutch. A maritime ques-
tion somewhat analogous to this is whether a vessel is piratical
which is manned by neutrals but is under the command of a
citizen of one of two belligerent Powers.²‘²

One of the cases which he pleads has a double interest for
υς, because it illustrates his method of argumentation and con-
cerns a subject which is much discussed at the present time. In
a passage in one of his speeches he tells us that before appearing
in court it was his practice to turn over in his mind everything
which could be said in support of his opponents. Indeed the
early part of most of his arguments consists of a categorical state-
ment of the case of the opposite side, supported by the laws and
text-writers who could be cited in its defense. In illustration of
this characteristic scholastic method, and because of the present-
day interest of the issue involved in the suit in question it may be
worth while to give an abstract of his argument.

An English ship while en route to Constantinople with a
cargo of general merchandise and powder, “pulvis tormenta-
rz‘us,” as Gentili calls it, was seized by the Sardinians and Maltese

and the cargo confiscated.15 Gentili appeared for the English
owners to contest the right of confiscation. Let us present his
conclusions in the same systematic way in which he sets them
forth in his plea in court. At the outset come the arguments,
marshalled firstly‚ secondly‚ and so forth, from the standpoint
of the Sardinians and Maltese: (1) The civil law, as it stands in
the Code of Justinian‚ prescribes capital punishment for any-
one who shall furnish the barbarians with munitioris of war.
(2) The canon law imposes excommunication upon Christians
who send arms to the Saracens, and the Saracens are amalga-
mated with the Turks. (3) The precedent of the Hanseatic cities
which were forbidden to furnish munitions of war to the Span-
