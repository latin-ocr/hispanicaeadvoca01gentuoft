3οα Introduction

The Spaniards ask to be permitted to cross to Belgium,
whither they had set out, under a royal safe conduct. It would
not be real redress to them, and it would not be a penalty to
the Dutch, for the offense which they have committed against
England's sovereignty‚ to send these Spaniards back to Spain,
because this disposition of the case is exactly what would
please the Dutch. It may be urged that the King of France
at one time sent Spaniards, who were on their way to Ireland
as enemies of England, back to Spain. The two cases are
not parallel, however. The Spanish do not seem to have
committed the offense against French sovereignty which the
Dutch have committed against English sovereignty‚ and being
sent to Spain they would be on the direct route to Ireland.

CHAPTER XV.-—Of the Enqlish who throuqh the assistance of the
treasury of the King] of Barbary have houqht property
taken from tlte Spaniards by pirates·

[The argument in this chapter supplements Chapter XII.]
English merchants claim to have bought the goods in con-
troversy from the fiscus of Barbary, and they claim legal
ownership under a constitution of Zeno’S‚ which enunciates the
principle that a prince may take the property of his subjects.
But the King of Barbary does not recognize the Justinian Code.
Consequently this constitution would not hold good in Barbary,
It is not even clear that a formal purchase was made from
the fiscus. The right of the fiscus to sell such property is open
to question, and the bad faith of the merchants is proved by
their effacement of the marks of the original owners.

There is no redress to be had from Barbary, and if the
procedure there is recognized as legal, the pirates will have
a convenient place, close to the Spanish lines of trade, to
dispose of their booty.

CHAPTER XVI.—Of the edict of the Kinq‚ bindinq those unaware of it.

England and Spain had made a treaty and under a royal
edict all hostile actions against Spaniards after April 24 were
forbidden. An English privateer made a capture on the high
seas after the date mentioned. Shall the English be required
to restore the property captured? It may be premised that the
