PREFACE

The republication of the classic works connected with the
history and development of international law was undertaken
by the Carnegie Institution of Washington in 1906, 31 the sug-
gestion of the undersigned‚ then Solicitor for the Dep'artment
of State, under whose supervision as General Editor the series
has since been published. On January 1, 1917, 1116 project
was transferred to the Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace and the publication of the series is being continued by the
Endowment’s Division of International Law.

The present volume, Gentili's Hispanica Advocatio, is edited
with an Introduction by the distinguished classicist‚ Professor
Frank Frost Abbott, who has also made the English translation
of the text of Gentili’s treatise.

The reasons for including Gentili's treatise are sufficiently
set forth by,Professor Abbott in his introduction. The original
text, issued in 1613 by the brother of the author, and five years
after his death, is exceedingly hard to get, for, although search
was made, no copy was to be had in London, Paris or Leipzig.
The photographic reproduction made from a copy of the second
edition, appearing in 1661, in the possession 01 1116 Library 01
Congress, places the work within the hands 01 any and all coun-
tries, and Professor Abbott‘s faithful translation of a text which
abounds in difficulties and which has not hitherto been translated
into English makes its mastery an easy matter to the English-

speaking world.

One reason for republishing the classics of International
Law is the difficulty of procuring the texts in convenient form
for scientific study3 the libraries in the United States have been
searched with the result that few of the earlier works were
to be found. Another reason is that some of the works selected
for republication have never been translated into English. The
American publicist is therefore at a disadvantage in consult-
ing works of admitted authority, and when found they are, as
it were, sealed books to all but trained Latinists. The specialist
is thus forced to rely upon summary statements and references
to them to be found in treatises on International Law, or is
driven to examine them in European libraries, often a difficult
task, while the general reader is practically barred from the
stores of knowledge locked up in the earlier works on the Law
of Nations. The same difficulty exists in Latin America, Japan,

and in a lesser degree in many European countries.
