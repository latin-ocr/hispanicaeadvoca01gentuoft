2οα Introduction

world constituted a single State, and Roman law was drawn up
for the citizens of this one State. But in the modern world there
are many independent sovereignties, and the Law of Nations
covers questions at issue between the citizens of these different
States. To this purpose the civil law, in view of the circum-
stances in which it grew up, is not adapted. The civil law,
commentators on it and precedents from antiquity are frequently
cited, but rather by way of confirming or illustrating rules de-
rived from contemporary usage. At the same time Gentili stands
between the ancient and the modern world, and his inheritance
from the ancient world is evident in many ways. It comes out
in the scholastic form of his argumentation, which carries us
back to the schools of the Middle Ages, It appears occa-

distinction which he tries to make in one passage ¹⁹ between
the meanings of certain words, or in the insistence in another

Great as were his achievements in the field of international
law, yet in stemming the tide in England which was setting to-

into marriage cases, into testamentary, ecclesiastical and maritime caseS, and
into others of this sort, which still have always been held to be the peculiar
province of those versed in the civil law, but granted that they have pushed
their way in, simply because those cases had to do with Englishmen‚ with English
concerns, with transactions carried on in England; on this account, pray, shall
they rush in and seize these cases involving foreigners? Even though this state
of affairs is in part to be explained by the daily increasing power of those who
srudy the common law, still the old landmarks should be preserved.21

In one of the two tasks then to which he devoted himself,
he in part failed, Ι mean in maintaining the supremacy of the
civil law over the common law in regulating those transactions
in which the civil law seemed to him especially applicable. In
the other he succeeded, for he set forth once for all in his
