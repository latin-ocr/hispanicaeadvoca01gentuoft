ὁα Preface

 

Eminent publicistS, European and American, who have <
been consulted as to the usefulness of the plan to republish
the ClassiCS, have indorsed the project and have pledged their
personal cooperation. The works to be included in the series
have not only been approved but suggested by them, so that
the undertaking is international in scope, in selection, and in
execution.

The underlying principle of selection has been to reissue
those works which can be said to have contributed either to the
origin or to the growth of International Law and the term
classic has been used in the broad rather than in the narrow
sense, so that no work will be omitted which can be said to
have contributed to the origin or growth of the Law of Na-
tionS. The masterpieces of Grotius will naturally be the
central point in the serieS, but the works of his leading prede-
cessors and successors will likewise be included. The text of
each author will be reproduced photographically, so as to
lay the source before the reader without the mistakes which
creep into a newly printed text. In the case of the early
authors the photographed text will be accompanied by a revised
text whenever that course shall seem desirable. An Introduc-
tion will be prefixed to each work, giving the necessary bio-
graphical details and stating the importance of the text and its
place in International Law3 tables of errata in the original will
be added, and notes deemed necessary to clear up doubts and
ambiguities or to correct mistakes in the text will be supplied.
Variations in suecessive editions of the text published in the
author's lifetime will be noted, but little or· nothing in the
nature of historical commentary will be furnished.

Each work will be accompanied by an English version made
expressly for the series by a competent translator.

It is hoped that the series will enable specialists as well as
general readers to trace International Law from its faint and
unconscious beginnings to its present ample proportions and
to forecast with some degree of certainty its future develop-
ment into that law which Mirabeau tells us will one day rule

the world.
